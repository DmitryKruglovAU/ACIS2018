Social media analytics (SMA) is a powerful tool that offer wide opportunities for academics and industry professionals. SMA relates to a number of tools to collect data from digital media platforms, process it into structured insights and assist in more information-driven decision making. The tutorial introduces SMA with R.


## Topics covered during the tutorial include:


1. Benefits and challenges working with social media data (textual/non-textual information, large data volume, API access)

2. Structure of the social media data (e.g. user-related data, posting related data, hashtags)

3. Connecting to a social media platform (e.g. authentication) and downloading data 
- [Setting up API access for Twitter] (# setup-API)
- [Downloading tweets with `twitterR`] (# downloading-tweets)


4. Data analysis of the profile information (e.g. followers, likes, dislikes, favorites - platform dependent)
- [Analyse tweets] (# analyse-tweets)

5. Data analysis of textual information and non-textual (e.g. user posts, comments, dynamics, sentiment analysis, word clouds, etc.)

[Analyse text tweets] (# analyse-text)

6. Visualisation of the social media data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
