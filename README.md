# Exploring social media analytics with R

# ACIS2018

Social media analytics (SMA) is a powerful tool that offer wide opportunities for academics and industry professionals. SMA relates to a number of tools to collect data from digital media platforms, process it into structured insights and assist in more information-driven decision making. SMA is an emerging paradigm which is characterized by high diversity of cross-disciplinary applications, interoperability challenges, data privacy issues, variety of available data types, diverse and heterogeneous data sources, cross-domain analytics and many other challenges. In the current global environment SMA has a critical role to facilitate decision-making to achieve organisational resilience and sustainability, improve business innovation, empower information and knowledge management.

Existing ready-made tools offer a generic approach to data analysis and have significant limitations in addressing a particular user needs as well as keeping updated with critical changes in social media data policies. These limitations can be overcome with a more tailored approach in the programming software environment. The tutorial will review social media analytics available through R programing language. R is an open source software that has a leading position in the data science world and is widely supported through cross-disciplinary usage. The tutorial will review a range of R packages available for social media analysis in R and will aim at teaching general principles of working with social media platforms and analysing information there. 

The tutorial will cover such widely popular social media platforms as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube and overview general principles of collecting data through platform Application Programming Interface (API), recent changes due to data privacy issues, data analysis approaches available for different data types as well as visualization of the findings and how to implement them in further decision making.

Topics covered during the tutorial include:

1. Benefits and challenges working with social media data (textual/non-textual information, large data volume, API access)

2. Structure of the social media data (e.g. user-related data, posting related data, hashtags)

3. Connecting to a social media platform (e.g. authentication) and downloading data 

4. Data analysis of the profile information (e.g. followers, likes, dislikes, favorites - platform dependent)

5. Data analysis of textual information and non-textual (e.g. user posts, comments, dynamics, sentiment analysis, word clouds, etc.)

6. Visualisation of the social media data
